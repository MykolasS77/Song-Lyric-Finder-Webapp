HOW TO RUN:


1.Download or clone the files.

4.Type "nodemon index.js" command line;

5.Open your web browser of choice;

6.In search bar type "localhost:3000". You should now see the app.

As the form suggest, type in the name of the artist and a song. Make sure there are no typos. After submiting, you should see the lyrics to your song on the screen. Cheers!
